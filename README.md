## Introduction
- This project aims to predict the price range of mobile phones using machine learning techniques.
- The code includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from "train.csv," containing various features related to mobile phones.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- EDA involves checking for missing values, exploring summary statistics, and visualizing the distribution of the target variable (price range).

## Machine Learning Model
- The machine learning model is implemented using the DecisionTreeClassifier from scikit-learn.
- The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained on the training set.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report are used to assess model performance.

## Results
- The trained model's accuracy on the test set is reported along with the confusion matrix and classification report.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Daniyal-Ali-Khan/Smartphone-Categorization-Model.git`
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script: `python mobile_price_prediction.py`
